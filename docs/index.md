New site for notes that I've been making while learning about epoxy/resin wood tables and creating my own desk.  I've quoted people where I had the quotes that I got them from, sorry if I missed one but send me a correction and I'll get it fixed!

# More Learning Resources
* [Black Tail Online Class](https://www.blacktailstudio.com/resin-workshops-1)
  
I'm sure there are a ton of YouTube videos, most I found skimmed over some parts, and deeper in others, so you might have to watch a lot, and also why I started taking these notes

* I haven't ordered from this place, yet, because of the projects I've done but heard great things about them, they have a great story and made in the USA!

2. [Rusty Design-Canada](https://rustydesign.ca/collections/epoxy-silicone-molds)

3. [Amazon-Kalinta](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYTZ2HMM?ref_=cm_sw_r_apin_dp_Z2PKQD75P8BDFF9G0266&language=en-US&fbclid=IwAR3W-UmnUjWQEKasfFz3M7qiuGXaxtT35gTlK4gN-M2ZSy-128oJKeaGhYk&th=1)

### Pressure Pot (to be used while the epoxy cures)
1. [Vevor](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Vevor+pressure+pot&rh=n%3A228013%2Cp_89%3AVEVOR&dc&ds=v1%3AEHKZBfKgeTnHBqo95jY3O0e7reG3ft5u5FTWJDNFL9U&crid=35KCG5BR69QFE&qid=1704435633&rnid=2528832011&sprefix=vevor+pressure+pot%2Caps%2C105&ref=sr_nr_p_89_1)

### Vacum Pot (to be used to get the bubbles out of the resin before you pour)
1. [Harbor Fright Vacuum Pump](https://www.harborfreight.com/search?q=PITTSBURGH+AUTOMOTIVE+vacuum+pump&brand=PITTSBURGH+AUTOMOTIVE&current=1&category=2145) - You still need a pot with this


### Heat Gun / Propane Torch
1. [Harbor Freight Heat Gun](https://www.harborfreight.com/power-tools/heat-guns-seamers/heat-guns/1500-watt-11-amp-dual-temperature-heat-gun-56434.html)
* So I haven't used this with epoxy yet, but I have had one for years and it's a basic heat gun, does the job.

2. [Home Depot Propane Torch](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Bernzomatic-Trigger-Ignition-Start-Blow-Torch-Kit-with-14-1-oz-Handheld-Propane-Gas-Cylinder-and-Adjustable-Flame-333084/202539561)
* Your basic torch you'll find about anywhere, though I do usually prefer the nicer torch if I'm using it a lot:

# Types of Epoxy
* [Rusty Design-Canada](https://rustydesign.ca/collections/epoxy)

# Preparing the Wood

### Removing any bark
* Unless you are going to 100% seal the bark, you'll want to remove it before starting the pour

### Sealing the wood

# Preparing the Epoxy
1. Make sure you are storing your epoxy in a temperature controlled environment, and definitely don't let it freeze
2. "Add the glitter or mix ins 40 mins after pouring and you will get an even dispersion."

### How to properly mix
1. If you are mixing < 1 gallon it's recommended to stir it slowly by hand in order to not introduce bubbles
2. Temperature of epoxy before/during mix needs to be no less than 65°F

\*NOTE: At one stage here do you put the epoxy in the pressure pot?

### How much mica powder to use?
1.  "It depends"  - most people will say to mix until you like the look, but sometimes for first-timers that's hard to gauge so what I was told as a general starting rule, is: 1/2 teaspoon per liter for opaque looking (non-translucent), and 1/16 of a teaspoon for a translucent finish

# Initial Pour
* Watch the temperatures
* Sand with 120 and clean with 90% alcohol between pours

# Flood Coat

# Top Coat

# Sanding the Wood
* Sand Paper increments:  80, 100, 120 (wipe down with damp towl to "pop" the grain out between sanding)
\* Note:  If you are going to use a top coat for the wood and you're not going epoxy coat it, refer to the manufacturers recommendation for how fine to sand it

# Sanding the Epoxy
* Sand Paper increments:  80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 240, 320, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000

# Final Coating the Wood
Always follow the manufacturers cure times for best results!  Like sanding, no shortcuts here!

\* NOTE: I could use some guidance on which of the Odie's works best for a natural wood finish  
\* NOTE:  I also like the idea of Odie's better, just because it doesn't contain the chemicals that Rubio or Osmo contain, personal preference  

* [Odie's Oil](https://odiesoil.com/odies-universal-oil-9oz/)

* [Odie's Wax](https://odiesoil.com/odies-wax-9oz/)

* [Rubio Monocoat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OA5V19K/?coliid=I1P6A5JR617BBV&colid=YK7S3ZPC0Q95&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1)

* [Osmo Polyx Hard Wax Oil](https://www.amazon.com/OSMO-Polyx-Hard-Wax-25-3/dp/B003RDW1UY/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/133-8261450-8434823?pd_rd_w=phb15&content-id=amzn1.sym.2b132e63-5dcd-4ba1-be9f-9e044543d59f&pf_rd_p=2b132e63-5dcd-4ba1-be9f-9e044543d59f&pf_rd_r=F1QV3XBJ3MN3H8DNTR49&pd_rd_wg=R63aJ&pd_rd_r=5b5e2dbe-8b4b-458a-85c4-3cbdb9a8daa3&pd_rd_i=B003RDW1UY&psc=1)
1. "I use a microfibre 100mm roller, and just roll it onto all my projects, though I've used a brush and rag at times too."
2. Reportedly more toxic than Rubio, but just as good of a finish once it's cured.

* [Walrus Oil]()
1. Not sure about this one, but I've seen it mentioned a couple of times

# Final Coating the Epoxy

# Adding Legs
\*NOTE: Seems to be one of the top asked questions, could use some good links to places that sell legs for those that can't build them
1. [Rusty Design-Canada](https://rustydesign.ca/pages/table-legs)

# Troubleshooting

* What to do if you get micro bubbles in the top coat?
1. Sand/router it down and re-pour a thin coat over the top

* What to do if you didn't pour enough and it shrinks down?
1. Pour another coat over top (should you do this as soon as possible or wait?)

* "My last flood coat and it has fully set what grade sand paper should I rough it up with first"
1. "a little more than 220 I use a 280", most comments are 220

* "I am making an epoxy river table with 2 waterfall edges, when I assemble the waterfall would it be best to use wood glue or epoxy resin?"
1. "Resin on the resin, glue on the wood"
