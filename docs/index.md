New site for notes that I've been making while learning about epoxy/resin wood tables and creating my own desk.  I've quoted people where I had the quotes that I got them from, sorry if I missed one but send me a correction and I'll get it fixed!

1. "Alcohol ink, liquid resin dye, acrylic paint. I’ve even added glitter glue to resin which made it so the glitter didn’t sink down" [Mladen Sakotic](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3519813941443536/user/546210525/?__cft__[0]=AZXMJ-FWAU1eN_523s9EDVMZzP42u1GPX7iX4chCGZf_8By5Z8RmuofHB7mpXJu6TAMEBSV5p-l8zsnrPA5qQ8cmHpL1wk3q0vnk9lOlH3yNOLpFMy7zA2UXmaM13gOdyRKI0jQusvb4QRwYS1IfBmoqZ5oTHd_7_y3hQix73I3Rgo2VWbICjaTP70GFGi_xpMA&__tn__=%2CdR]-R)


# Tools You'll Want/Need
Some of these tools are optional depending on the project, but I'll list some known good tools I have used or others have reviewed.

### Router
1. [Harbor Freight - Herculeus](https://www.harborfreight.com/12-amp-variable-speed-fixed-base-router-with-plunge-base-kit-57368.html)
* I only used this once so far, replacing a really old Black and Decker, so far so good!

### Router Bit(s)

### Router Bowtie template
1. [Rocker Bow Tie Kit](https://www.rockler.com/rockler-bow-tie-inlay-starter-kit-with-frame-bit-and-bushing)

### Circular Saw Track Guide

### Orbital Sander (with dust collector)

### Epoxy Spreader
1. [Amazon - Dynatron](https://www.amazon.com/3M-358-Dynatron-Spreader/dp/B0015DMGD0/ref=sr_1_2?crid=13WEISCSRINXK&keywords=epoxy+resin+spreader+tool&qid=1704350460&sprefix=epoxy+resin+spread%2Caps%2C101&sr=8-2)

### Epoxy Mixing Container

### Epoxy Mixing Tool

### Silicon Molds

1. [Crafted Elements](https://craftedelements.com/)
* I haven't ordered from this place, yet, because of the projects I've done but heard great things about them, they have a great story and made in the USA!

### Heat Gun / Propane Torch

# Preparing the Wood

### Removing any bark
* Unless you are going to 100% seal the bark, you'll want to remove it before starting the pour

### Sealing the wood

# Preparing the Epoxy

### How to properly mix

### How much mica powder to use?
1.  "It depends"  - most people will say to mix until you like the look, but sometimes for first-timers that's hard to gauge so what I was told as a general starting rule, is: 1/2 teaspoon per liter for opaque looking (non-translucent), and 1/16 of a teaspoon for a translucent finish

# Initial Pour

### Watch the temperatures

# Flood Coat

# Top Coat

# Sanding the Wood
* Sand Paper increments:  80, 100, 120, 150
\* Note:  If you are going to use a top coat for the wood and not epoxy coat it, refer to the manufacturers recommendation for how fine to sand it

# Sanding the Epoxy
* Sand Paper increments:  80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 240, 320, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000

# Final Coating the Wood
Always follow the manufacturers cure times for best results!  Like sanding, no shortcuts here!

* [Rubio Monocoat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OA5V19K/?coliid=I1P6A5JR617BBV&colid=YK7S3ZPC0Q95&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1)

* [Osmo Polyx Hard Wax Oil](https://www.amazon.com/OSMO-Polyx-Hard-Wax-25-3/dp/B003RDW1UY/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/133-8261450-8434823?pd_rd_w=phb15&content-id=amzn1.sym.2b132e63-5dcd-4ba1-be9f-9e044543d59f&pf_rd_p=2b132e63-5dcd-4ba1-be9f-9e044543d59f&pf_rd_r=F1QV3XBJ3MN3H8DNTR49&pd_rd_wg=R63aJ&pd_rd_r=5b5e2dbe-8b4b-458a-85c4-3cbdb9a8daa3&pd_rd_i=B003RDW1UY&psc=1)
1. "I use a microfibre 100mm roller, and just roll it onto all my projects, though I've used a brush and rag at times too."
2. Reportedly more toxic than Rubio, but just as good of a finish once it's cured.

# Final Coating the Epoxy

# Adding Legs

# Troubleshooting

* What to do if you get micro bubbles in the top coat?
1. Sand/router it down and re-pour a thin coat over the top

* What to do if you didn't pour enough and it shrinks down?
1. Pour another coat over top (should you do this as soon as possible or wait?)

* "My last flood coat and it has fully set what grade sand paper should I rough it up with first"
1. "a little more than 220 I use a 280", most comments are 220
